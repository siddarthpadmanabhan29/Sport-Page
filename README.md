Sports Entertainment Web Application:

Overview:
This is a project I worked on creating a dynamic sports entertainment website which was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This website is continually expanding towards a variety of sports and updating the styles and paradigms. For right now the main sports this site includes are the NFL, NBA, MLB, IPL, and Tennis which is currently in progress.

Users can hover each sport link and will be able to browse teams, view schedules, and check standings for now. I plan to incorporate a news page for each sports that updates in real time soon.
The schedules page for each sport incorporates a filtering system (similar to the CTRL + F command) and a dark mode feature for users to interact with. 
The darkmode feature has been incorporated using a built-in local storage API that saves the memory of the user's preference for the next interaction.

Program Features:
Multi-page website that currently includes naviagtion for different leagues with more coming soon.
Dynamic schedule pages with week selections and team search filter.
Teams page includes hoverable and clickable card that features the team's logo and name. (The team card also takes the user to the respective team's webpage when clicked.)
Clean Styling effects for each page of the website.

How to run/view website:
To run: I would suggest visual studio code as the best destination for running the code as it includes several files within a folder.
Next, go to the extensions tab and perform a quick installation of any live server. 
Then, right click the file in the editors tab and an option for open with live server can be selected.
This will take you to a web browser to view and see changes in real time.

To view fully polished site: Check the link within this Github repository to interact with the website.

Keep in mind:
*** The tennis page is currently under works! ***
*** The news pages for each league sport is currently under works! ***
